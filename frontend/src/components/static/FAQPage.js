      question: "What is Taonga Tracker?",
      answer: "Taonga Tracker is a family heritage application for documenting, organizing, and preserving heritage items and family relationships across generations. It creates digital records of family heirlooms with photos, stories, and other information."
    },
    {
      question: "Is Taonga Tracker free to use?",
      answer: "Yes, this is an academic project developed for educational purposes and is completely free to use at this stage. However, please note this is a prototype system and not a commercial product. This may change in the future."
    },
    {
      question: "How do I get started?",
      answer: "Simply create an account by clicking \"Sign Up\" and start adding your family members and heirlooms. You can build your family tree and document your heirlooms with photos and descriptions."
    },
    {
      question: "Is my data secure?",
      answer: "While we implement basic security measures, this is an academic project and may not have commercial-grade security. Please avoid uploading highly sensitive personal information. Data is encrypted in transit, but currently not at rest."
    },
    {
      question: "Can I export my data?",
      answer: "Yes, you can export your family and heirloom data through the settings page. This allows you to download your information in JSON format."
    },
    {
      question: "What file formats are supported for photos?",
      answer: "The application supports common image formats including JPEG, PNG, and WEBP. For best results, use high-quality photos under 5MB in size. Images are subject to denial if they exceed the size limit or are marked as suspicious."
    },
    {
      question: "Can I share my family tree with others?",
      answer: "Currently, this MVP version focuses on individual family documentation. Sharing features may be added in future versions of the project. Fields for sharing currently do not function."
    },
    {
      question: "What happens to my data when the project ends?",
      answer: "As this is an academic project, data storage is temporary. We recommend regularly exporting your data. The project timeline and data retention policies will be communicated as the project progresses."
    },
    {
      question: "Can I delete my account?",
      answer: "Yes, you can delete your account and all associated data through the security settings page. This action is permanent and cannot be undone."
    },
    {
      question: "Who can I contact for support?",
      answer: "For technical support or questions about the project, you can contact the development team through the email provided in the footer of the website."
